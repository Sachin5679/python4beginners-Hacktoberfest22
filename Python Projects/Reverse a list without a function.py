1) Initialize start and end indexes as start = 0, end = n-1
2) In a loop, swap arr[start] with arr[end] and change start and end as follows :
start = start +1, end = end â€“ 1

def reverseList(A, start, end):

 while start < end:

 A[start], A[end] = A[end], A[start]

 start += 1

 end -= 1

# Driver function to test above function

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

print(A)

reverseList(A, 0, 5)

print("Reversed list is")

print(A)
